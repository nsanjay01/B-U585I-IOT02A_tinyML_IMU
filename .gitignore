## 3. The Importance of `.gitignore`
Before you `git push`, make sure you don't upload the massive build folders. Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root:

```text
# Build directories
build/
bin/
obj/

# Secure/Non-Secure build specific
Secure/build/
NonSecure/build/

# IDE files
.project
.cproject
.settings/
.vscode/cmake-kits.json
.vscode/launch.json
